InstaBail is a fun offline mobile web app that generates random excuses (bails) and easily lets you share them. It uses real-time train delay information for more realistic bails. [Tweet to me](https://twitter.com/shutdownscanner) with your ideas for more bails! Or open a PR.

InstaBail uses the TfL API and my [Huxley project](https://github.com/jpsingleton/Huxley) to proxy live railway departure data. It also checks for [any current tube strikes](https://isthetubeonstrike.com/).

You can add this app to your phone's home screen. Simply press the share/menu button in the browser toolbar then press "Add to Home Screen". If you launch the app from there it will run full screen. It even works offline (but you won't get all the bails without internet).

If you like mobile web apps then you should check out [Yo Flow](https://yoflow.uk/), my app for gyms and personal trainers to induct new clients. Or read [my blog](https://unop.uk/).
